                <p class="bio-text">
                    I am an aspiring educator from the beautiful village of Yabrang in Trashigang Dzongkhag, Bhutan.
                    Rooted in the rich culture and traditions of my homeland, I am a dedicated learner and future
                    teacher
                    who dreams of using technology to transform education in my community.
                    I believe in the power of knowledge and continuous learning to create positive change.
                    With a strong passion for ICT and teaching, I am committed to guiding students to become
                    innovative thinkers, lifelong learners, and responsible digital citizens.
                    My journey is driven by the desire to bridge the gap between tradition and technology,
                    making learning accessible and meaningful for all.

                    Born and raised in the beautiful Bhutan. When I am not busy learning, you will likely find me
                    exploring new technologies, reading educational content, or sharing knowledge with my friends.

                            classroom and getting to explore and create with my own hands.

                            throughout the day. I have more homework and bigger projects, and I'm learning how to manage
                            my time. The social scene is also a lot more important, and I am figuring out where I fit in
                            while trying to balance my studies with my friends.

                            career. I have more freedom to choose what I study, and I'm also managing a busier schedule
                            with clubs and social events. It's a time of figuring out my own interests and taking more
